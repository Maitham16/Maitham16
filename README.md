- 🖐️ Hi, I’m Maitham Alrubaye.
- 🎓 I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering and am currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science.
- 💡 I undertook a project on Ray Tracing Using C++, inspired by one of my favorite master's classes and a book titled "Ray Tracing in One Weekend".
- 💖 For me, programming is as compelling as a love interest.
- 🚀 Copilot is my trusted sidekick in coding.
- 📝 The references mentioned in the comments are either from the aforementioned book or from the YouTube channel, Avery Makes Games.
- 🙏 I greatly appreciate the efforts of my professors: Mr. Manfred Klaffenböck, Mr. Torsten Möller, and Mr. Julian Schneebaur.
